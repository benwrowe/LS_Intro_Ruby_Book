#What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
#The major difference between an array and a hash is that a 
#hash contains a 'key value pair' for referencing by key.


hash = { dog: 'fido', cat: 'fluffy'}

array = ['fido', 'fluffy']

puts hash[:dog]
puts array[0]


#array is a sequence of elements and each element can be accessed by its index
